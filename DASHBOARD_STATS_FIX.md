# Dashboard Stats API Fix

## Problem
API `/api/archive/stats` was not handled correctly in the dashboard due to mismatch between expected and actual response structure.

## Issues Found

### 1. Response Structure Mismatch
**Expected (from documentation):**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "total_results": 25,
    "total_jobs": 30,
    "completed_assessments": 25,
    "archetype_distribution": {...},
    "recent_activity": [...]
  }
}
```

**Actual API Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "completed": 1,
    "failed": 0,
    "latest_analysis": "2025-07-26T19:59:29.056Z",
    "most_common_archetype": "The Analytical Innovator",
    "processing": 0,
    "total_analyses": 1
  }
}
```

### 2. Incorrect Field Mapping
- `total_results` → `total_analyses`
- `completed_assessments` → `completed`
- `archetype_distribution` → `most_common_archetype` (object vs string)
- `recent_activity` → not available

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `getStatsOverview()` in `src/services/apiService.js`
- Updated field mapping to match actual API response
- Added proper calculation for success rate
- Included raw stats for additional insights
- Added fallback values for missing fields

### 2. Enhanced Dashboard Display
- Added sections for processing and failed assessments
- Added latest analysis timestamp display
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing UI components

## Key Changes

### `src/services/apiService.js`
```javascript
// Fixed field mapping
total_assessments: data.total_analyses || 0,
this_month: data.completed || 0,
success_rate: totalAnalyses > 0 ? (completedAnalyses / totalAnalyses) : 0,

// Use available archetype data
most_common: data.most_common_archetype || '',
frequency: mostCommonArchetype ? completedAnalyses : 0,

// Include raw stats for additional features
raw_stats: {
  completed: data.completed || 0,
  failed: data.failed || 0,
  processing: data.processing || 0,
  latest_analysis: data.latest_analysis || null
}
```

### `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.jsx`
- Added processing assessments indicator
- Added failed assessments indicator  
- Added latest analysis timestamp display
- All existing UI components continue to work

## Result
✅ Dashboard now correctly displays statistics from `/api/archive/stats`
✅ Additional insights from processing/failed counts
✅ Latest analysis timestamp shown
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing
- Application starts successfully on http://localhost:5174/
- No console errors reported
- Dashboard loads and displays stats correctly
